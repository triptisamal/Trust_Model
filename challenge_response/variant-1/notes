No Normalization
-------------------
From Test13, 14: Final convergent value for confidence depends on the score given on physical validation; thres does not matter.
From Test0: Final convergent value for confidence depends on the thres; score given on physical validation does not matter if the score is less than the thres.

Normalization
--------------
From Test7,12: Final convergent value for confidence depends on a combination of the values of thres and physical validation score; the normalization value does not matter.





Check: 11 vs 12 check output to see if it is the decay that is causing the instability. Then, that will give information about what the decay rate should be for a mobility (fast or slow).

DONE: If i remove decay, test 11 simulation stops. So decay is the reason for simulation not stopping. I should lower the rate of decay for my formula.
